# Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of the **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)** algorithm, a powerful method in reinforcement learning designed to solve the classic **multi-armed bandit problem**. The UCB algorithm is applied to optimize ad selection based on click-through rates (CTR) in a simulated environment.

## Overview

The multi-armed bandit problem is a foundational challenge in decision-making under uncertainty, where the goal is to maximize rewards by balancing the exploration of new options and the exploitation of known ones. The Upper Confidence Bound algorithm addresses this by providing a dynamic strategy that adapts to changing conditions, making it particularly useful in contexts like online advertising.

This project demonstrates the UCB algorithm in action, applying it to a dataset that simulates user interactions with different ads. The algorithm optimizes ad selection to maximize the cumulative number of clicks over time.

## Features

- **UCB Algorithm Implementation**: A clear and concise implementation of the UCB algorithm from the ground up.
- **Real-World Application**: Applied to a simulated ad selection scenario, mimicking a real-world online advertising challenge.
- **Performance Visualization**: Generates visual insights into the effectiveness of the UCB algorithm over multiple rounds.

## Dataset

The project uses a simulated dataset, `Ads_CTR_Optimisation.csv`, representing the click-through rates (CTR) for different ads. Each row in the dataset corresponds to a round, and each column represents a different ad. The goal is to identify the ad with the highest CTR while making the fewest possible errors.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Python installed on your machine along with the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ucb-algorithm.git
   cd ucb-algorithm
   ```

2. **Run the Notebook**:
   Open the Jupyter Notebook `upper_confidence_bound.ipynb` and execute the cells step-by-step to see the UCB algorithm in action.

3. **Understanding the Code**:
   - **Library Imports**: The necessary libraries (`numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`) are imported to handle data processing and visualization.
   - **Dataset Loading**: Load the dataset using `pandas`:
     ```python
     dataset = pd.read_csv('Ads_CTR_Optimisation.csv')
     ```
   - **Algorithm Implementation**: The UCB algorithm is implemented to select ads based on their estimated potential to maximize CTR.
   - **Visualization**: Results are visualized using `matplotlib`, showing the total rewards accumulated by the algorithm over time.

## Results

The UCB algorithm's performance is visualized, typically in a plot showing the cumulative number of clicks (rewards) over time. The algorithm efficiently balances exploration and exploitation, leading to a rapid increase in total rewards.
